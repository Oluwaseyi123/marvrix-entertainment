                It is with deep regret that we as a team have made a sad decision to cancel the Marvrix 2020 End of the
year  party, in light of the current uncertain situation with Covid-19 and also the circulating newly released
guidelines and regulations.
Like most event of this nature, we made an excellent plan, booked a beautiful venue, got special chefs,
Wonderful performing acts, started advertising and marketing the event, designed adverts and printed tickets
many weeks in advance, and as each day passes, those expenses mount up. It would be irresponsible for us to
proceed with the planning and spending without the firm knowledge that the event would take place due to
Covid-19.
We are very disappointed to make this announcement but we have a duty of care to staff, volunteers, performing
acts, our members and most importantly the wonderful people that are planning to come for the event.
All pre-purchased END OF THE YEAR tickets will be fully refunded, please contact who you made payment and
got your tickets from for full refund or contact any Marvrix member if you got your tickets on our website.
We will be working in the background to bring you a better event once everything is settled and confirmed  it is
Safe to do so.
This to marvrix mebers is not a set back but a push forward
This to marvrix members is not a set back but a push forward
